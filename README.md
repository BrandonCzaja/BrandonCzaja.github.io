The page is split into two sections, left side and right side. On the left side, users can use the Magic: The Gathering API to search for individual cards by name. On the ride side, users can use the carousel to see the symbols for each set, using he Scryfall API.

Users will be able to click on the set symbol and see the Card Image Gallery for the set.
